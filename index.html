                    Welcome to our research on gender discrimination in sports. Despite significant progress toward gender equality in many areas of society, sports continue to reflect persistent imbalances in participation and representation between male and female athletes. This study aims to explore the extent of gender inequality across various sports and nations, shedding light on trends that reveal whether certain sports are more gender-equal or gender-unequal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes sex, nation, and sport category, we aim to assess the male-to-female athlete ratio and understand the disparities in athlete involvement. Our research seeks to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing conversation about gender equality in sports, with the goal of informing policies and initiatives that promote equal opportunities for all athletes. Join us as we explore the state of gender representation in sports and uncover areas where progress is still needed.
                
                    Through a thorough examination of these variables, the investigation aspires to elucidate the manner in which societal constructs dictate the opportunities afforded to women in the realm of sports.
