                    Women's Olympic journeys have been made a distinction by decades of struggle, marginalization, and, finally, empowerment. Female athletes' involvement in the Olympic Games has historically been influenced by wider socioeconomic issues such as economic growth, political systems, and cultural views toward gender equality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Understanding the factors influencing female athlete engagement is critical to fostering gender equality in sports. This research will examine three interrelated questions:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 text-purple-900">
                    <li>The influence of political and economic determinants on female athlete representation</li>
                    <li>Correlation between gender equity in sports participation and national gender inequality</li>
                    <li>Patterns of female athlete representation in relation to economic progress</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Through a thorough examination of these variables, the investigation aspires to elucidate the manner in which societal constructs dictate the opportunities afforded to women in the realm of sports.
