                <p>Examine the amount of gender discrimination in sports through an examination at how male and female athletes are represented in various sports and countries. Identify trends in gender equality or disparity by examining the male-female athlete ratio in various sports and national contexts. Determine the amount of gender equality or discrimination in sports participation using a dataset that includes gender, nation, and sport category information. Provide insight into the existing state of gender representation in sports, with the goal of identifying areas where more development is required to achieve equal opportunities for both genders.

                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">This chart paints a vivid picture of how male and female athletes are distributed across different sports. The x-axis represents the female ratio, which is the percentage of female athletes in each sport, ranging from 0% to 100%. Meanwhile, the y-axis lists various sports, each with the total number of athletes indicated in parentheses.
Bubbles with a Purpose The size of each bubble in the chart is proportional to the total number of athletes in that sport. Larger bubbles mean more athletes are participating. 
The color of the bubbles tells another story: blue bubbles represent female-dominated sports, while red bubbles signify male-dominated ones. There's also a gray band in the middle that highlights sports with a relatively balanced gender distribution (40-60% female ratio).

This provides a clear picture of how gender preferences may shape athlete participation in various sports.
